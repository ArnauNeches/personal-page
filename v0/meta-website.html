                <h3> Initial goal and methodology:</h3>
                <p>
                    The main goal of this project is to learn web development while I create my own personal website.
                    This idea comes from the realization that I lack personal projects (Apart from some smaller or uni
                    related stuff) and that when you learn the most (At least in software development, maybe not in
                    math) is when you develop (How surprising is this? hahaha).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve this and to see a cool evolution as time goes by, I will start developing the page with
                    very simple technologies (I really mean it, the first version is going to be pure html). Every new
                    version of the website will adopt new technologies and in the actual site you will be able to see
                    previous versions (Or at least that's my initial idea, maybe in a few months this becomes a
                    cryptocasino; Who knows? ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will also try to rely on AI as little as possible to generate code. It is undeniable that AI is a
                    super useful tool, but I think that it should be used with boundaries if our goal is to learn (I
                    swear not a single word on this page has been AI-generated). Of course, I will use it as a tutor
                    to learn, but I think that I will learn much more if every (maybe some, almost-surely is enough for
                    us P(line written by AI)=0) line of code is written personally by me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TL;DR: My goal is to learn web development by doing this page.
                    I will do it in an iterative way, adopting new technologies on each version.
                    I'll try to use AI as little as possible to learn as much as possible.

                <h3> Version 0: </h3>
                <p>
                    Merry Xmas! This first version of the web-page is going to be simply html, nothing else. I think
                    this early stage of the development is one of the most difficult parts because you actually have to
                    write text hahaha. The page will be simple: A main page with three sections (Who I am, Projects,
                    Interests) and some other individual pages such as meta-website (Where this will be written) or
                    books. The books page will be connected with a database in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I deployed. For this first version I simply used Vercel but this may change in the future. I also
                    had to buy and configure the domain (Fortunately we learnt how DNS works at Uni hahah).

        <p> 
            Hi, I'm Arnau from Seville, Spain. I am a fourth year student of a double bachelor degree in Pure Mathemathics
            and Computer Science at The University of Seville. Currently an exchange student at The University of Sydney.

            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p> I like to understand things fundamentally and to solve difficult problems, because of this, I chose to study Math and CS. Math is rigorous, formal and gets to the root of the things which I love, while in CS computers stop being a black box and start becoming something I can understand. </p>
            <p> In CS my main interest is AI/ML. I am currently a research assistant at my home university at the <a href="https://grupo.us.es/minerva/">Minerva Research Group</a> working on attribute selection.</p>
            <p> Appart from this, I also enjoy learning about low level stuff like computer architecture, operating systems or networks.</p>
            <p> On the math's side, I started being an Algebra fan, then switched to analysis and topology and then back to Algebra. Now seeing it with perspective, the order I just said coincides with the branch I had the best professors each year which in conclusion tells us that I like well taught things. Okay, I accept this is very ambiguous, if it was a life or death question I would probably say analysis (Sorry Algebra fans).</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>One of the main reasons I started with this website was because of the lack of real projects I had. Hopefully, the list below will increase with the time</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/ArnauNeches/personal-page">Personal website</a>: This website has as its main goal that I learn web development. Because of this, I develop in parallel this <a href="meta-website.html">meta-website</a> which explains all my thinking process when developing this page, every decision I take and an overview of what I learn within the development.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/ArnauNeches/COMP3520-OS-Internals">Operating Systems</a>: Some C programs related with multi-threading and kernel scheduling.</li>
                <li>TBD... etc</li>
            </ul>
